Resource failure class is including 3 simple test programs and a complex benchmark as follows:
a. memcpy1.c
This program can be used for injecting the following failure modes: 
 MemoryExhaustion(Res)
 InvalidPointer(Res)
 LowMemory(Res)
 MemoryLeak(Res)
 StalePointer(Res)
 UnderAccumulator(Res)


b: Deadlock.c
This program can be used for injecting the following failure modes: 
 DeadLock(Res)
 ThreadKiller(Res)

c.functions.c
This program can be used for injecting the following failure mode:
 CPUHog(Res)

d.MCF.ll
MCF.ll is a benchmark which is derived from SPEC CPU2006 Benchmarks. It includes more than 5000 lines of bit code, and it is applicable for all failure modes of this 
class except deadlock(Res) and threadkiller(Res).
