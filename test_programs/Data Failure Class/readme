Resource failure class is including 2 simple test programs and a complex benchmark as follows:
a. memcpy1.c
BufOverflowMalloc(Data)
BufOverflowMemmove(Data)
WrongPointer(Data)
WrongDestination(Data)
WrongSource(Data)

b.functions.c
This program can be used for injecting the following failure modes:
NoOutput(Data)
IncorrectOutput(Data)

c.MCF.ll
MCF.ll is a benchmark which is derived from SPEC CPU2006 Benchmarks. It includes more than 5000 lines of bit code, and it is applicable for all failure modes of this 
class.
