Resource failure class is including 2 simple test programs and a complex benchmark as follows:
a. memcpy1.c
NoOpen(API)
NoClose(API)
WrongMode(API)
WrongAPI(API)
BufferOverflow(API)
BufferUnderflow(API)
InappropriateClose(API)

b.functions.c
This program can be used for injecting the following failure modes:
 NoOutput(API)
 IncorrectOutput(API)

c.MCF.ll
MCF.ll is a benchmark which is derived from SPEC CPU2006 Benchmarks. It includes more than 5000 lines of bit code, and it is applicable for all failure modes of this 
class.
