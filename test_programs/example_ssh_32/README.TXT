This test program is compiled with llvm-gcc 4.2.1 under 32 bit Ubuntu 10.04

Please run "ssh llfi@sdf.org" with password "llfitest" before run the injection.
It is because the first run on one machine needs the user to add sdf.org to the known RSA list.
Once it is added to RSA list, such prompt won't appear again and injection test can begin.
